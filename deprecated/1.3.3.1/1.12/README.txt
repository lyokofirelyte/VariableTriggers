VariableTriggers.jar is the updated version of VTV2 - the one with the seperate folders for everything.
VTV1-1.3.3.jar is the old version of VT that Lex had created, updated to 1.12.

Both of these plugins will work alongside each other. If you install both, all of the commands for VTV2 will need to have a "2" after them - for example:

/vtwalk2, /vt2, /vtcmd2, etc.

If you do not use the old version alongside the new one, you do not need to add the "2" to the commands.
